Step-by-step:

    Command:

    iverilog -o testbench_fpu.vvp -DCOMPRESSED_ISA testbench_fpu.v picorv32.v fpu/floating_point_multiply.v fpu/fmuls.v fpu/file_source.v

        iverilog is a Verilog compiler (part of the Icarus Verilog toolchain).

        It compiles the listed Verilog files into a simulation executable named testbench_fpu.vvp.

        The -D option (-DCOMPRESSED_ISA) defines a macro called COMPRESSED_ISA during compilation — as if somewhere in your Verilog code you wrote ifdef COMPRESSED_ISA.

        Files being compiled:

            testbench_fpu.v → your testbench (the simulation harness).

            picorv32.v → looks like a RISC-V core (specifically PicoRV32).

            fpu/floating_point_multiply.v → hardware description of floating-point multiplication.

            fpu/fmuls.v → likely floating-point multiplication support logic (maybe soft-float helper).

            fpu/file_source.v → probably some module that reads test inputs from a file for simulation.

    Command:

    chmod -x testbench_fpu.vvp

        This removes executable permissions from the .vvp file.

        Normally .vvp files aren't directly executed like ELF binaries; instead, they are run through vvp, a simulation driver.

        This step is optional but harmless: it just prevents accidentally trying to run ./testbench_fpu.vvp directly.

    Command:

    vvp -N testbench_fpu.vvp

        This executes the compiled Verilog simulation.

        vvp reads the .vvp file and simulates it.

        -N suppresses the interactive prompt and allows for more "scripted" or "automated" simulation (good for Makefile usage).

Summary:

You're compiling a testbench that verifies your FPU logic (specifically floating-point multiplication) together with a PicoRV32 core, and then running the simulation.
It's a standard build-simulate flow for Verilog-based projects using Icarus Verilog.
